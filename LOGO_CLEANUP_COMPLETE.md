# Logo Files Cleanup - Complete ✓

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully completed

## Problem Identified
The system was referencing **4 logo files** but only **1 file** actually existed in the `/brand` folder:
- ❌ `/bisman_logo.svg` (referenced but not in brand folder)
- ❌ `/bisman_logo.png` (referenced but not in brand folder)
- ❌ `/bisman_lockup.png` (referenced but not in brand folder)
- ✅ `/brand/logo.svg` (only actual brand file)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Code Updates
Updated references to use only the actual brand logo:

**File: `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`**
- ❌ Removed: `brandCandidates` array with 4 logo paths
- ✅ Changed to: `const brandImgSrc = '/brand/logo.svg';`
- Simplified state management (removed unnecessary `brandIndex`)

**File: `src/components/SuperAdminControlPanel.tsx`**
- ❌ Removed: Fallback array `['/bisman_logo.svg', '/bisman_logo.png']`
- ✅ Changed to: Direct reference to `'/brand/logo.svg'`
- Simplified error handling with single `logoError` state

### 2. File Cleanup
Deleted old unused logo files from `/public` folder:
```bash
rm -f bisman_logo.svg bisman_logo.png bisman_lockup.png
```

### 3. Verification
- ✅ No remaining references to old logo files (except false positive in test script)
- ✅ Only `/brand/logo.svg` exists and is used
- ✅ Code is cleaner and more maintainable

## Current State

### Brand Folder (`/public/brand/`)
```
logo.svg  (1.2K) - Primary company logo
```

### Public Folder (`/public/`)
```
.well-known/
bisman-loader.json
brand/
locales/
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Single source of truth for brand logo
2. **Maintainability**: No confusion about which logo to use
3. **Performance**: No unnecessary fallback logic
4. **Clarity**: Code is simpler and easier to understand
5. **Storage**: Removed 3 unused files

## Next Steps

If you need to add more brand assets:
1. Place them in `/public/brand/` folder
2. Update code references to use `/brand/{filename}`
3. Keep all brand assets centralized in one location

## Notes

- The logo uses SVG format for scalability
- Error fallback shows a simple "B" placeholder if logo fails to load
- All references now point to `/brand/logo.svg`
