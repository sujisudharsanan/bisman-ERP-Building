# Railway Monorepo Configuration
# ================================
# This project has two services that need to be configured in Railway Dashboard:
#
# SERVICE 1: bisman-ERP-frontend
#   - Root Directory: my-frontend
#   - Dockerfile: my-frontend/Dockerfile
#   - Port: 3000 (or use $PORT)
#
# SERVICE 2: bisman-ERP-backend  
#   - Root Directory: my-backend
#   - Dockerfile: my-backend/Dockerfile
#   - Port: 8080 (or use $PORT)
#
# IMPORTANT: You MUST set "Root Directory" in Railway Dashboard for each service!
# Go to: Service -> Settings -> Source -> Root Directory
#
# This file is for documentation only. Railway reads service-specific configs from:
#   - my-frontend/railway.toml
#   - my-backend/railway.toml
