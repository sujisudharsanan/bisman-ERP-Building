## 🎯 Why It's Not Showing in User List

Bot accounts sometimes don't appear in the regular "Users" list because:
- They're filtered as "Bots" not "Users"
- System might have a separate "Bot Accounts" section
- Bots are hidden from general user search by default

**But the bot IS working!** Just try messaging it directly.
