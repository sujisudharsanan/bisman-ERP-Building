Write a scheduled job that:
- Runs every hour, finds tenants where trial_expires_at < now and has no active subscription.
- Marks tenant as `trial_expired=true` and reduces quotas to free-tier.
- Send email to tenant admins asking to upgrade with a one-click payment link (Stripe Checkout).
- Ensure job is idempotent and logs audit events.

Cron example (node-cron):
```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
cron.schedule('0 * * * *', async () => { await runTrialExpiryJob(); });
```

Job Requirements:
1. Query tenants where:
   - trial_expires_at < NOW()
   - trial_expired = false OR NULL
   - subscription_status IS NULL or NOT IN ('active', 'trialing')

2. For each expired tenant:
   - Set trial_expired = true
   - Set plan = 'free'
   - Update quotas to free tier limits
   - Create audit log entry

3. Send upgrade email with:
   - One-click Stripe Checkout link
   - Features comparison (trial vs free)
   - Urgency messaging

4. Idempotency:
   - Skip tenants already marked as trial_expired
   - Use database transaction for atomicity
   - Log all operations for debugging
